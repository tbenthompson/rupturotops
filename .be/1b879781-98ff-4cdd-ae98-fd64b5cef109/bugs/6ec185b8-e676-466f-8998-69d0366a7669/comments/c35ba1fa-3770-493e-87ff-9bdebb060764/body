To test numerics, I need some benchmark:
--Does it devolve to the elastic case if there isn't any creep?
--Does it devolve to the interseismic viscoelastic case if the creep is linear
  and there aren't any rupture dynamics
--Does it devolve to Takeuchi and Fialko if there isn't any fault heating or
  rupture dynamics
