jim and I talked today about rupture modelling with viscoelastics

in essence, he would like to take the nadia lapusta elastodynamic models and add in viscoelasticity

he presentd the whole quasi-dynamic approxmation for ruptures
--this is what is in zheng and rice and the yehuda and jim papers
--assumes that the functional representing wave propagation is 0
--assumes that the solution to the wave equation has no "incoming" component, in the d'alembert formulation
--using a quasidynamic approximation might vastly simplify the situation, but the eventual goal is to get the system running a fully dynamic model
--however quasidynamic would lose any effect of downward propagating waves creating dfferent conditions for the propagation of rupture

we talked about various possiblities for the numerical solution
--i need to get access to nadia's code and see what she is doing
--investigate the spectral element method -- look at the tromp, komatitsch stuff
--investigate some of the recent papers by nadia's group looking to see if they're using anything special and new
--maybe email junle to see what he thinks about nadia's work
--write some sort of document (blog post?) on the differences and pros/cons of all the different modelling methods by the various dynamic rupture researchers -- noda, dunham, lapusta, ampuero, who else oes this stuff? madariaga? ben-zion? steven day
--finite difference (day, dunham), boundary integral element method (lapusta), FEM (ampuero, barall), discontinuous galerkin (Tago 2012 is the reference, also ADER-DG)

discontinuous galerkin looks like a really promising idea
--allows huge range of adaptivity with both elliptic and hyperbolic equations
