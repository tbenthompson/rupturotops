Things to do:
finish cleaning up the code 

test correctly with the right numbers and such
clean up the whole directory so that the modules can interface and there's one controlling script
implement/clean up the data saving and loading modules
test with a series of superimposed gaussians from different times going back different amounts of time, look at when it stabilizes, when does it stabilize?!
test for various different temperature values
parallelize in a clean and nice way
provide more output
