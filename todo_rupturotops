Current Primary Goal:
A! give Jim an initial analysis of whether I think the problem is tractable
--figure out the necessary lower end of the length scale

current tasks:
A! restart and successfully write a fdm method for the wave equation
A! implement full elastodynamics in 1D
A! download and successfully run eric dunham's mdsbi
A! look up some papers by kelemen on thermal runaway
A! pose the wave equation in the antiplane case in the DG formulation

A! check out some of the better FDM implementations of earthquake dynamics
A! is the ADER-DG local time stepping possible in the DGCrack formulation?
A! write a page on the differences between DGCrack and ADER-DG
A! compile all the relevant literature on discontinuous galerkin methods
https://github.com/carlomr/tspeed
A! learn about the cohesive zone stuff in the day and lapusta paper 2005
A! get my hands on some codes!
A! get nadia's code or reproduce the method
A! read about viscoelastic wave propagation
A! find the viscoelastic weak form

testing the numerics:
--does it devolve to the elastic case
--does it devolve to the interseismic viscoelastic case
--does it devolve to any analytical solutions

read:
http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/1176/adaptive-mesh-refinement-with-perfectly-matched-layers
read about perfectly matched layers
learn a lot more about adaptive meshing techniques!

the ampuero sem2dpack info pages are useful

eventually:



A! read about and write a blog post on each major pde discretization
--FDM
--FEM
--FVM
--Boundary Integral Element Method
--SEM
--Discontinuous Galerkin
--hp FEM
