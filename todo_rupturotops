Current Primary Goal:
A! give Jim an initial analysis of whether I think the problem is tractable
--figure out the necessary lower end of 


current tasks:
A! finish reading the nadia lapusta paper
A! read the details of the discontinuous galerkin paper -- DGCrack
A! pose the wave equation in the antiplane case in the DG formulation



http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2008JB006271/abstract
A! compile all the relevant literature on discontinuous galerkin methods

https://github.com/carlomr/tspeed
A! learn about the cohesive zone stuff in the day and lapusta paper 2005
A! read the jeroen tromp and komatitsch papers on SEM
A! read about the extended element method
A! read about the enhanced element method
A! get my hands on some codes!
A! talk to jenny about numerical methods
A! talk to zhigang suo about numerics
A! read about viscoelastic wave propagation
A! find the viscoelastic weak form

what are PETSc an Trilinos?
http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/1176/adaptive-mesh-refinement-with-perfectly-matched-layers
read about perfectly matched layers
learn a lot more about adaptive meshing techniques!

the ampuero sem2dpack info pages are useful

eventually:



A! read about and write a blog post on each major pde discretization
--FDM
--FEM
--FVM
--Boundary Integral Element Method
--SEM
--Discontinuous Galerkin
--hp FEM
