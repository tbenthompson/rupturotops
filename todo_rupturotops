Current Primary Goal:
A! give Jim an initial analysis of whether I think the problem is tractable
--figure out the necessary lower end of the length scale

current tasks:
A! maybe extend the one-d model to include stress evolution from the quasi-dynamic approximation
A! maybe extend the ond-d model to incorporate full dynamics
A! look up some papers by kelemen on elastic 
A! need a realistic during earthquake stress profile
A! need a realistic temperature rise
A! consider using a better integrator in the heat/creep solution

A! pose the wave equation in the antiplane case in the DG formulation

A! is the ADER-DG local time stepping possible in the DGCrack formulation?
A! write a page on the differences between DGCrack and ADER-DG
A! compile all the relevant literature on discontinuous galerkin methods
https://github.com/carlomr/tspeed
A! learn about the cohesive zone stuff in the day and lapusta paper 2005
A! read about the extended element method
A! get my hands on some codes!
A! get nadia's code or reproduce the method
A! read about viscoelastic wave propagation
A! find the viscoelastic weak form

testing the numerics:
--does it devolve to the elastic case
--does it devolve to the interseismic viscoelastic case
--does it devolve to any analytical solutions

read:
http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/1176/adaptive-mesh-refinement-with-perfectly-matched-layers
read about perfectly matched layers
learn a lot more about adaptive meshing techniques!

the ampuero sem2dpack info pages are useful

eventually:



A! read about and write a blog post on each major pde discretization
--FDM
--FEM
--FVM
--Boundary Integral Element Method
--SEM
--Discontinuous Galerkin
--hp FEM
