Current Primary Goal:
A! give Jim an initial analysis of whether I think the problem is tractable
--figure out the necessary lower end of the length scale

current tasks:
A! pose the wave equation in the antiplane case in the DG formulation
A! solve the gaussian temperature profile problem with a nonlinear temperature dependent flow law, look at the dependence on time and distance from the fault, is the quick response or the slow response more important
--look at the segall book for initial stress profiles

A! is the ADER-DG local time stepping possible in the DGCrack formulation?
A! write a page on the differences between DGCrack and ADER-DG
A! compile all the relevant literature on discontinuous galerkin methods
https://github.com/carlomr/tspeed
A! learn about the cohesive zone stuff in the day and lapusta paper 2005
A! read about the extended element method
A! get my hands on some codes!
A! read about viscoelastic wave propagation
A! find the viscoelastic weak form

testing the numerics:
--does it devolve to the elastic case
--does it devolve to the interseismic viscoelastic case
--does it devolve to any analytical solutions

http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/1176/adaptive-mesh-refinement-with-perfectly-matched-layers
read about perfectly matched layers
learn a lot more about adaptive meshing techniques!

the ampuero sem2dpack info pages are useful

eventually:



A! read about and write a blog post on each major pde discretization
--FDM
--FEM
--FVM
--Boundary Integral Element Method
--SEM
--Discontinuous Galerkin
--hp FEM
